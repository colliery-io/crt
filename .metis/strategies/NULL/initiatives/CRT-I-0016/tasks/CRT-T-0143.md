# Create demo theme with event-driven effects

**Phase 6** - Testing and demonstration.

## Objective

Create a demo theme showcasing all event types to verify functionality and serve as documentation for theme authors.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Demo theme includes all 5 event types
- [ ] `::on-bell` - visual flash + optional sprite
- [ ] `::on-command-fail` - red tint, sprite patch or overlay
- [ ] `::on-command-success` - brief sparkle/celebration
- [ ] `::on-focus` - brief highlight flash
- [ ] `::on-blur` - dimmed colors, slowed animation
- [ ] Theme works without OSC 133 (bell + focus still work)
- [ ] Includes sprite assets for demo effects
- [ ] Documented with comments explaining each effect

## Implementation Notes

### File: `assets/themes/events-demo.css`

Create a demo theme that showcases all event capabilities. Could be based on an existing theme (nyancat or pipboy) or standalone.

### Test Scenarios

1. **Bell**: `echo -e '\a'` or Ctrl+G
2. **Focus**: Click away from window, click back
3. **Command fail**: `false` or `(exit 1)` (requires starship/OSC 133)
4. **Command success**: `true` or `ls` (requires starship/OSC 133)

### Dependencies
- All other tasks completed (full feature working)

## Status Updates

*To be added during implementation*
