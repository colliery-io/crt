# Implement multi-window support with shared config

*This template includes sections for various types of tasks. Delete sections that don't apply to your specific use case.*

## Parent Initiative **[CONDITIONAL: Assigned Task]**

[[CRT-I-0007]]

## Objective **[REQUIRED]**

Implement proper multi-window support where Cmd+N creates a new independent window, each with its own tabs, shells, and GPU surface. The application should follow macOS conventions where closing all windows doesn't quit the app.

## Backlog Item Details **[CONDITIONAL: Backlog Item]**

{Delete this section when task is assigned to an initiative}

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria **[REQUIRED]**

- [ ] Cmd+N creates new window (even when window already exists)
- [ ] Each window has independent tabs and shells
- [ ] Closing one window doesn't affect other windows
- [ ] Closing last window keeps app running (macOS behavior)
- [ ] Clicking dock icon reopens window when none exist
- [ ] Cmd+Q quits entire application (closes all windows)
- [ ] Window resize works independently per window
- [ ] Tab operations (new, close, switch) work within each window
- [ ] Shell output appears in correct window/tab
- [ ] Menu actions target the focused window

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Approach

**Architecture Change**: Refactor from single-window to multi-window model.

1. **Create `WindowState` struct** containing per-window data:
   - `window: Arc<Window>`
   - `gpu: GpuState` (surface, renderers, tab bar)
   - `shells: HashMap<u64, ShellTerminal>`
   - `content_hashes`, `cols`, `rows`, `scale_factor`
   - `dirty`, `frame_count`, cursor state

2. **Update `App` struct**:
   - Replace single-window fields with `windows: HashMap<WindowId, WindowState>`
   - Add `focused_window: Option<WindowId>` for menu action routing
   - Keep shared state: `config`, `font_scale`, `modifiers`, menu

3. **Key Implementation Steps**:
   - Extract window creation into `create_window()` method
   - Route all `window_event` handlers by WindowId lookup
   - Update `about_to_wait` to iterate all windows
   - Handle NewWindow action by calling `create_window()`
   - Track focused window for menu action routing

### GPU Resource Sharing

- Share `wgpu::Instance`, `Adapter`, `Device`, `Queue` across windows
- Each window needs its own `Surface` (tied to window)
- Glyph cache can be shared since same device/font

### Dependencies

- winit multi-window support (already supported)
- wgpu surface-per-window model (standard pattern)

### Risk Considerations

- **Surface recreation**: Each window needs careful surface lifecycle management
- **Focus tracking**: winit doesn't directly expose focused window; track via events
- **Resource cleanup**: Ensure proper cleanup when windows close

## Status Updates **[REQUIRED]**

*To be added during implementation*
