# Sprite patch paths should be relative to CSS file, not base sprite

## Problem

Currently, `--sprite-path` in event selectors (e.g., `::on-command-fail`) is resolved relative to the **base sprite's directory**, not the theme CSS file.

This is counterintuitive because:
- All other paths in CSS are relative to the CSS file
- Theme authors expect consistency
- Leads to confusing bugs like path doubling

## Current Behavior

```css
:terminal::backdrop {
    --sprite-path: "sprites/idle.png";  /* relative to CSS */
}

:terminal::on-bell {
    --sprite-path: "alert.png";  /* relative to sprites/ dir, NOT CSS! */
}
```

## Expected Behavior

All sprite paths should be relative to the CSS file:

```css
:terminal::on-bell {
    --sprite-path: "sprites/alert.png";  /* same as backdrop */
}
```

## Root Cause

In `sprite_renderer.rs`, `base_dir` is extracted from the base sprite path:
```rust
let base_dir = std::path::Path::new(&config.path)
    .parent()
    .map(|p| p.to_path_buf());
```

Patch paths are then resolved against this `base_dir` instead of the theme directory.

## Fix

Pass the theme directory to the sprite renderer and use it for resolving all sprite paths, including patches.
