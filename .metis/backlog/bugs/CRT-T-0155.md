# OSC 133 shell events not captured after app install

## Problem

After installing CRT as an app (vs running from cargo), OSC 133 semantic prompt events are not being captured. This means:
- `::on-command-success` never fires
- `::on-command-fail` never fires
- Reactive theming for command results doesn't work

## Expected Behavior

Shell integration should work the same whether running from:
- `cargo run`
- `./target/debug/crt`
- `/Applications/CRT.app`

## Investigation Areas

1. **ZDOTDIR setup** - Is the shell init script path being resolved correctly?
   - Check if `assets/shell/crt-zsh-init/.zshrc` is bundled in the app
   - Verify the path resolution for installed app vs dev build

2. **Shell spawning** - Is `semantic_prompts=true` being set?
   - Check logs for "Zsh semantic prompts enabled via ZDOTDIR"

3. **OSC parsing** - Are the escape sequences being received?
   - Add debug logging in `crt-core/src/lib.rs` for OSC 133 parsing

4. **Event propagation** - Are events reaching the theme system?
   - Check if `ShellEvent::CommandSuccess/CommandFail` are being emitted

## Reproduction

1. Install CRT.app
2. Use robco-reactive or nyancat-responsive theme
3. Run a failing command (e.g., `false`)
4. Observe: sprite should change but doesn't
