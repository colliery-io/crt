# UX Polish & Visual Feedback Initiative

*This template includes sections for various types of initiatives. Delete sections that don't apply to your specific use case.*

## Context

Users lack visual feedback for many actions. Errors are only logged (not surfaced to users). Search has no UI overlay showing match count. Config/theme load failures are silent. There's no confirmation for clipboard operations, creating a "did it work?" experience.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Add search UI overlay showing "N of M matches"
- Surface config/theme errors to users (toast or status)
- Add font size indicator during Cmd+/-
- Design copy feedback system (careful: bell flash already uses screen flash)

**Non-Goals:**
- Complex notification center
- Sound effects

## Requirements **[CONDITIONAL: Requirements-Heavy Initiative]**

{Delete if not a requirements-focused initiative}

### User Requirements
