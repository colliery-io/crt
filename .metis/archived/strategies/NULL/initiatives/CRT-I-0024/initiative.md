# Accessibility Foundation Initiative

*This template includes sections for various types of initiatives. Delete sections that don't apply to your specific use case.*

## Context

Zero accessibility support exists. No focus indicators show which UI element has keyboard focus. Context menu and search bar lack keyboard-only navigation. Screen reader integration is absent. Users who rely on keyboard navigation or assistive technology cannot effectively use the application.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Add focus indicators for interactive elements (context menu, search, tabs)
- Enable keyboard-only navigation for context menu (arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
- Enable keyboard navigation for search UI
- Document accessibility features and limitations

**Non-Goals:**
- Full screen reader support (future initiative)
- WCAG AA compliance (aspirational, not v1)

## Requirements **[CONDITIONAL: Requirements-Heavy Initiative]**

{Delete if not a requirements-focused initiative}

### User Requirements
- **User Characteristics**: {Technical background, experience level, etc.}
- **System Functionality**: {What users expect the system to do}
- **User Interfaces**: {How users will interact with the system}

### System Requirements
