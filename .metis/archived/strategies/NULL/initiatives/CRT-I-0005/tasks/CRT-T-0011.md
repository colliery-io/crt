# Phase 1: Set up workspace structure

*This template includes sections for various types of tasks. Delete sections that don't apply to your specific use case.*

## Parent Initiative **[CONDITIONAL: Assigned Task]**

[[CRT-I-0005]]

## Objective

Convert the current single-crate project into a Cargo workspace with four crates following the architecture plan. Preserve existing examples and shaders.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Root Cargo.toml converted to workspace configuration
- [ ] `crates/crt-core/` directory created with Cargo.toml and lib.rs
- [ ] `crates/crt-renderer/` directory created with Cargo.toml and lib.rs
- [ ] `crates/crt-theme/` directory created with Cargo.toml and lib.rs
- [ ] `crates/crt-app/` directory created with Cargo.toml and main.rs
- [ ] Existing examples still compile and run
- [ ] Workspace dependencies defined for shared versions

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Approach
1. Create workspace root Cargo.toml with `[workspace]` section
2. Create each crate directory with minimal Cargo.toml
3. Move existing dependencies to appropriate crates
4. Keep examples at root level referencing workspace crates

### Directory Structure
```
crt/
├── Cargo.toml              # [workspace] members = ["crates/*"]
├── crates/
│   ├── crt-core/
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml
│   │   └── src/lib.rs
│   ├── crt-renderer/
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml
│   │   └── src/lib.rs
│   ├── crt-theme/
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml
│   │   └── src/lib.rs
│   └── crt-app/
│       ├── Cargo.toml
│       └── src/main.rs
├── shaders/                # Unchanged
└── examples/               # Unchanged
```

### Dependencies
None - this is the first task

## Status Updates **[REQUIRED]**

*To be added during implementation*
